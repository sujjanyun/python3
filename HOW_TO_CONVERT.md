# How to convert our existing code into OOP
* Create a class (blueprint that defines what they all are), maybe call it 'Pets'

# AT LEAST 3 METHODS
* 'feed pet'
* 'play with pet'
* 'get hungry and mopey*

# TWO CLASS 2 ATTRIBUTES (maybe more/maybe instance)
* 'fullness'
* 'happiness'

# 1 INSTANCE ATTRIBUTE
* 'name'

# function that needed - self always shows up
def __init__(self, name)
# maybe more
